## Introduction to Bash Script Calculator

This project is a simple calculator implemented using a Bash script. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and factorial calculation.

## Features:
Interactive User Input: The script prompts the user to select an operation and enter the necessary numbers for the calculation.
Supported Operations:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Modulo (%)
Factorial (!)
Error Handling: The script handles division by zero and invalid operation inputs gracefully.

## Usage:
Save the script as calculator.sh.
Make it executable with the command chmod +x calculator.sh.
Run the script using ./calculator.sh and follow the prompts to perform calculations.
This project demonstrates basic Bash scripting skills, including user input handling, arithmetic operations, and control structures like loops and conditionals. It provides a foundation for building more complex command-line tools in a Unix-like environment.
